' Standard flag values (bit-coded values):
'
' 1 = If set, this is a paper space view
'
' 16 = If set, table entry is externally dependent on an xref
'
' 32 = If both this bit and bit 16 are set, the externally dependent xref has been successfully resolved
'
' 64 = If set, the table entry was referenced by at least one entity in the drawing the last time the drawing was edited. (This flag is for the benefit of AutoCAD commands. It can be ignored by most programs that read DXF files and does not need to be set by programs that write DXF files)

' The following codes appear only if code 72 is set to 1. They define the UCS that is associated to this view. This UCS will become the current UCS whenever this view is restored (if code 72 is 0, the UCS is unchanged).
